# A Git(Hub) Test Repository

Hey! This is my personal Git(Hub) Test Repository where I experiment with Git and GitHub. 

If you are new to Git and GitHub and found this repository through Google: feel free to clone the repository and experiment with it! You will not be able to push back to the repository, as it is *my* repository and I cannot let everybody push to it. The right way to do it on GitHub is: 

1. fork the repository in your own account, 
2. make changes and push them in a branch of your own fork, 
3. create a Pull Request in my repository. 

I will get notified, will review the changes that you propose, and eventually will either merge the changes, or reject them. This *may* take some time as I am not actively monitoring nor maintaining this repository, as you can guess, but I try to be helpful ;)

> NOTE
> If you want your PR to have a chance to get merged, please propose additions or changes to neutral files such as text files or small images. If you propose changes to the GitHub workflow files, to `.gitignore`, etc. they will quite probably be rejected.

Don't expect to find anything meaningful nor useful in the repository. Also, I happen to force-push a reset of everything from time to time. This means that I reset all history, including changes that you may have submitted. In theory, noone ever does this to a repository. But hey, this is a *test* repository after all.

The rest of this README file is mostly random stuff.

Clone the repository with: `git clone https://github.com/zpqrtbnk/test-repo.git .`

We have test GitHUb pages (from the `gh-pages` branch) at: http://zpqrtbnk.github.io/test-repo/ 

We have an image in the README (markdown)

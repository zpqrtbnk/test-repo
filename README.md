=========

Test Repository

`git clone https://github.com/zpqrtbnk/test-repo.git .`

We have pages at : http://zpqrtbnk.github.io/test-repo/ 

Edit the file  
Add an image  
Can't get a newline? Must add two spaces  

Include  
![Image](https://raw.github.com/zpqrtbnk/test-repo/master/wtf.jpg)

But I don't know how to float the image left or right, nor how to center it, nor how to size
it so it's very basic anyway...


`git add`  
`git push origin master`  
`git pull`  
`git checkout`  

etc
etc
